The University of Cambridge Data Protection Officer can be contacted at dpo@admin.cam.ac.uk. 

### Information we may collect about you 

We do not aim to collect or store any data that would allow us to identify individuals using this app. To safeguard your privacy, we will only collect data on information you choose to share with us if you consent to participating in the study. If you do not consent to participating in this study, we do not collect any information on you. The information you choose to give us can include your MIST answers and results, and any questions you voluntarily choose to answer, which may include your age, level of education, political affiliation, or other demographic variables. We do not collect any identifying information through our Web Site that will allow us to identify you personally. All data that we collect will be stored on a password-protected computer that is only accessible to academic researchers at the University of Cambridge.

### Data Retention

We will keep the information that you provide us with for as long as necessary for the study.

### Uses made of the information

We use information held about you in the following ways:
- to administer Our Site and for internal operations, including troubleshooting, data analysis, testing, research, statistical and survey purposes;
- to improve Our Site to ensure that content is presented in the most effective manner for you and for your Device/computer;
- to allow you to participate in interactive features of Our service, when you choose to do so;
- as part of Our efforts to keep Our Site safe and secure;
- for research purposes carried out internally or by trusted third parties.
- Your information will be used for non-commercial, non-political scientific purposes only, to help us better understand people's misinformation-related behavior.

We may disclose your personal information to third parties:
- If the University of Cambridge or substantially all of its assets are transferred to a third party organisation, in which case personal data held by it about its customers will be one of the transferred assets.
- If We are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of the University of Cambridge, Our customers, or others.

### Where We store your personal data

All information you provide to Us is stored on secure servers held in both the European Economic Area (EEA) and GDPR compliant international data processors only. Where international data processors are used, all appropriate technical and legal safeguards will be put in place to ensure that you are afforded the same level of protection as within the EEA.

Once We have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access. We retain personal information for as long as need or permitted in light of the purpose(s) for which it was obtained and consistent with the applicable law.

### Data Sharing to Comply with Open Science Standards

In order to comply with open sciences standards administered by academic journals, we may share limited raw data on open science platforms so that others can replicate or re-analyze it. This data will exclude any personally identifiable information (age, gender, etc.) from the self-report questions so that there are no privacy risks or risks of de-identifying individuals. We will only show data about your MIST results, and not the information that you share about your personal preferences or demographic characteristics. 


### Deleting Data

If you wish to delete your data, we generate a unique, anonymous, randomly generated ID, and you can use it to request deletion of your data by emailing Yara Kyrychenko (yk408@cam.ac.uk) with the ID within one year of study completion. Your user ID is shown after you fill out the consent form. Alternatively, if you lose this ID, you can tell us as much as possible about your submission and we will try to locate it and delete it.

### Your rights

The Data Protection Legislation gives you a series of rights in relation to your personal information including, but not limited to, the right to access information held about you. For an overview of your rights and how to exercise them, please refer to our general privacy page: https://www.information-compliance.admin.cam.ac.uk/data-protection
